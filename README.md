⚖️ Responsible Use & Legal Disclaimer
PayOffFP is an Entropy-Aggregation system designed strictly for security research, bot mitigation, and fraud prevention.

Ethical Use: This software should not be used for invasive cross-site tracking or to violate user privacy. It is intended to distinguish between automated "headless" browsers and legitimate human users to protect digital infrastructure.

No Warranty: This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. The weighted penalty model is a heuristic approach; while it provides high-accuracy signals, no fingerprinting method is 100% infallible.
